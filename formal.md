# Formalism and Simplification of Round 2 Procedure

Consider a permutation $\pi$ of $n$ elements. An observer is given the first element of the permutation $\pi_1$, and is tasked with predicting if $\pi_2$ is greater than $\pi_1$. If the prediction is correct, he is then tasked with predicting if $\pi_3$ is greater than $\pi_2$. 

The obserever has the knowledge that he is sampling from a permutation on $n$ elements, but does not know which permutation. He also has access to all sampled elements. What is the expected number of predictions the observer will get correct before an incorrect prediction, for a given $n$? 

Let $\mathbb{E}(X_n)$ be the expected number of correct predictions before an incorrect prediction.
